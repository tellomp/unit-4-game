# Crystal Game

### Overview

* There are four crystals on the page which the player click on. 
* On each click, each crystal will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
* The game hides this amount until the player clicks a crystal and once the crystal is clicked the score counter is updated.
* A random number is generated and the player has to match this number with every click of any of the four crystals.
